This is a simple webpage that makes it (somewhat) easier for Mozilla
Foundation employees to report their expenses using good ol' HTML
instead of a error-prone hodgepodge of Microsoft Excel and various image/PDF
manipulation apps.

Because the webpage was converted from an Excel spreadsheet in the
first place, the HTML is kind of gross.

The JavaScript in `expensify.js` automatically adds up all your expenses,
numbers them, and generates attachment pages for your receipts, so all
you have to do is fill out some [table rows][] and print the resulting page.
View [index.html][] for an example.
