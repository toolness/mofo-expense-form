This is a simple webpage that makes it (somewhat) easier for Mozilla
Foundation employees to report their expenses using good ol' HTML
instead of a error-prone hodgepodge of Microsoft Excel and various image/PDF
manipulation apps.

Because the webpage was converted from an Excel spreadsheet in the
first place, the HTML is kind of gross.

See [this line][] for information on how to add your own expenses.
